# Challenge description

Write a function that accepts a string and returns the second highest numerical digit in the input as an integer.

The following rules should apply:

* Inputs with no numerical digits should return -1
* Inputs with only one numerical digit should return -1
* Non-numeric characters should be ignored
* Each numerical input should be treat individually, meaning in the event of a joint highest digit then the second highest digit will also be the highest digit

For example:

* "abc:1231234" returns 3
* "123123" returns 3
