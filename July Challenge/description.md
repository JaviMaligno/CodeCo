The countdown refreshes before your eyes. The algorithm that controls the device before you shrinks its output once more. No one knows what will happen when it returns zero.

To diffuse the device, you must take the outputs provided by the algorithm and rearrange them as a RATS sequence

You know The RATS (Reverse Add Then Sort) sequence is a mathematical sequence where the next term in the sequence is calculated by reversing the latest term, adding it to itself and then sorting the result in ascending order.

For example, if the sequence is applied to 1:

1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 77â€¦

77 is achieved by 16 + 61 (no sorting necessary).

Write a method which will accept terms in the above RATS sequence and return the next term in the sequence. Your method should accept and return positive integer values only. If an input or output is either negative or too large then you should return -1.

Hurry, You don't have much time left!
