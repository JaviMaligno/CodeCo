# Challenge description

Write a function that takes a string and returns the longest case-insensitive pattern in that string.

A pattern is an alphabetically ascending sequence of at least two characters. If no pattern is found an empty string will be returned. If two or more patterns are found with the same length return the first.

For example:

* "acwxyzabghwxyo" will return "wxyz",
* "azbycxdwev" will return the empty string,
* "abcaeabcaeabcdabcd" will return "abcd".
