# Challenge description

Write a function which takes an array of integers and returns true if the elements of the array can be divided into 2 groups whose sums are equal.

For example:

Given the array `[2, 5, 3]` the function would return `True`.

The array `[2, 5, 3]` can be split up into the two groups `[5]` and `[2, 3]` whose sums are both 5.
