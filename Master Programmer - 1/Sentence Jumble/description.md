# Challenge description

Given an English sentence passed as a single string, generate a "jumbled" representation by sorting the characters of each word alphabetically.

The sentence may contain both capital letters and punctuation. Any capitalised characters within a word should retain their position within the word (though the character itself may change). Similarly any punctuation and spacing used should also remain in its original position.

For example, "The cat sat on the Ikea mat." would result in "Eht act on eht Aeik amt.".
