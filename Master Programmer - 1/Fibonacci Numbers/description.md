# Challenge description

Starting with $0, 1$, the Fibonacci sequence can be defined as a sequence of numbers where the number's value is the sum of the preceding 2 integers in the sequence. For example:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13`. Create a method which can take in any integer and determine whether it is a Fibonacci number or not. Your solution should be able to deal with the maximum size of an integer as an input.
